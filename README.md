## HTML Conversion tool for Adobe Campaign ready templates

JAFAR is an acronym. It stands for Jack's Automated Find And Replace. I am Jack. Hello!

JAFAR is an interface and a PHP script which looks for a number of pre-defined code snippets in a template and replaces them with Adobe friendly versions.

In short, it automates the manual process of finding and replacing items in a template.
